# OSRS_Item_Price_Checker
Tells you the price of items within Old School Runescape

Curently requires the local JSON file of a dict containing all the item ids,
looking at requesting this data through OSRSBox or a similar website.

Need to add:
  Loops, 
  Adjust for errors in typing e.g. rune LONGsword would be fine
    instead of correct spelling 'Rune longsword',
  Partial item matches, display a list and select from which one,
  Multiple items
